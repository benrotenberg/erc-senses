<em>The SENSES (making <b>S</b>ense of <b>E</b>lectrical <b>N</b>oise by <b>S</b>imulating <b>E</b>lectrolyte <b>S</b>olutions) project aims at providing an integrated understanding of electrical fluctuations in bulk, interfacial and confined ionic fluids.</em> 
</p>

<p class="text-justify"> 
Using molecular and mesoscopic simulations, we will consider various types of such fluctuations, probed by seemingly unrelated experiments, which offer complementary windows on the multiscale individual and collective dynamics of ions in these systems.
