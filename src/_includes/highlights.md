Laura Scalfi among the 2021 L'Oréal-UNESCO Young Talents France for Women in Science
====================================================================================

Congratulations to Laura for this impressive achievement! More details [here](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/portraits/laura-scalfi).

Laura has now moved to Berlin for a post-doc in Roland Netz's group at the Freie Universität Berlin.


Jeongmin Kim starts his post-doc (10/18/2021)
=============================================

Jeongmin will work on molecular simulations of concentrated electrolytes, to understand Surface Force Balance experiments. 

On the experimental side, we will benefit from a collaboration with Susan Perkin at the University of Oxford.


Giovanni Pireddu starts his post-doc (04/01/2021)
=================================================

Giovanni will work on mesoscopic simulations of electrode-electrolyte interfaces, to understand nano-electrochemistry experiments.
 
On the experimental side, we will benefit from a collaboration with Vincent Noël at Université de Paris.

Iurii Chubak starts his post-doc (11/23/2020)
=============================================

Iurii will work on molecular simulations of electric field gradient fluctuations in electrolytes, to understand the NMR relaxation of quadrupolar nuclei. 

On the experimental side, we will benefit from the expertise of colleagues in the PHENIX laboratory: Anne-Laure Rollet, Guillaume Mériguet, Pierre Levitz and Jean-Pierre Korb.

Minh-Thé Hoang Ngoc starts his PhD (10/1/2020)
==============================================

Minh-Thé will use mesoscopic simulations to investigate ionic current fluctuations through nanotubes. 

On the experimental side, we will benefit from a collaboration with Lydéric Bocquet at Ecole Normale Supérieure. 


The SENSES project starts (10/1/2020)
=====================================

It will last until 9/30/2025.
