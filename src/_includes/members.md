They are not funded by the project, but work with the principal investigator on closely related topics:

* [Laura Scalfi](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/portraits/laura-scalfi) is a former PhD student (funded by the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation), supervised by Benjamin Rotenberg. During her PhD (2018-2021), she studied electrochemical interfaces using molecular simulations, including charge fluctuations, and is one of the main developers of the [MetalWalls](https://gitlab.com/ampere2/metalwalls/) code. She contributed to different aspects of the SENSES project and is co-author of several resulting publications. She is now a post-doctoral researcher at the [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html).

* Dominika Lesnicki is a former post-doctoral research associate (funded by the ANR-DFG NEPTUNE project then by the FET-OPEN NANOPHLOW project), working with Benjamin Rotenberg from 2018 to 2020, on electric current fluctuations to predict the non-linear response of electrolytes to electric fields. She contributed to one of the publications of the SENSES project. She is now a post-doctoral researcher at [CEA](https://www.cea.fr/). 

* [Sophie Marbach](http://sophie.marbach.fr/) was a Marie Sklodowska Curie Research fellow, principal investigator of the Molecular Control project (2020-2023), for the fine control of molecular or ionic transport  in  non  equilibrium  systems  driven  by  electric  or  chemical  gradients.
